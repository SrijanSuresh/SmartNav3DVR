## Extra Functionalities & Features (Extra Credit)

### Custom VR Camera Prefab (Critical Fix)
- Google's Cardboard XR plugin repeatedly crashed the Android app.  
- Built **BinocHead**, a custom VR camera rig prefab with **left/right cameras**.  
- Each camera renders half of the screen (`0‚Äì0.5` and `0.5‚Äì1.0`).  
- Added **GyroControl script** to rotate the prefab using the device gyroscope.  
- **Result:** Stable stereo VR view that runs on phone + headset, full control, avoids crashes, delivers a real VR experience.

### Additional Features
- Cart headlights turn on only at night.  
- Building interior lighting with transparent glass walls for realistic night glow.  
- Custom skyboxes for day/night cycles with stars and sun.  
- Variety of buildings for a city-like environment.  
- Minimap that always stays in the scene.  
- Custom inventory GUI with limits for package pickup/drop at stations.  
- Jump and rotation controls for Xbox/PlayStation controllers.
